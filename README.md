# Data Structures and Algorithms with C++ Practice

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics using C++. I've been learning and practicing these concepts through a course by Love Babbar, and I've organized my solutions according to the following topics:

## Topics Covered
1. **C++ Fundamentals**: Basic concepts and syntax of C++ programming language.
2. **Patterns**: Implementing different patterns using loops and symbols.
3. **Complexity**: Understanding time and space complexities of algorithms.
4. **Arrays**: Problems and implementations related to arrays.
5. **Searching-Sorting**: Algorithms for searching and sorting arrays and data.
6. **Characters & Strings**: Manipulation and algorithms related to strings.
7. **Math & Pointers**: Mathematical operations and understanding pointers.
8. **Recursion & Backtracking**: Implementing algorithms using recursion and backtracking techniques.
9. **Divide & Conquer**: Strategies and problems involving divide and conquer approach.
10. **OOPs**: Object-Oriented Programming concepts and practice.
11. **Linked List**: Implementations and problems related to linked lists.
12. **Stack**: Implementing stack data structure and relevant problems.
13. **Queues**: Implementations and problems related to queues.
14. **Trees**: Concepts, implementations, and problems involving trees.
15. **Binary Search Trees**: Implementations and problems specific to BSTs.
16. **Heaps**: Implementing heap data structure and problems.
17. **Maps & Tries**: Implementations and problems involving maps and tries.
18. **DP (Dynamic Programming)**: Dynamic programming concepts and problems.
19. **Graph**: Implementations and algorithms for graphs.
20. **Sliding Window**: Problems and solutions using sliding window technique.
21. **Greedy Algorithms**: Problems solved using greedy algorithms.
22. **Bit Manipulation**: Implementations and problems involving bit manipulation.

## Repository Structure
- Each topic has its dedicated folder.
- Inside each folder, you'll find C++ files containing problem solutions or implementations.
- Some folders may contain explanations or READMEs for complex problems or concepts.

Feel free to explore the solutions and implementations for different DSA topics. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are welcome!
